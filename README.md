# Saola
A minimalistic web site monitoring tool for Google App Engine.
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mschuetz/saola.png)](http://travis-ci.org/mschuetz/saola)

## Setup
Register a (free) GAE application, let's say you call it <MYAPP>.

	git clone https://github.com/mschuetz/saola.git
	cd saola
	sed -i bak -e s/INSERT_APP_NAME/<MYAPP>/ app.yaml
	appcfg.py update .

Open (as the application administrator) https://<MYAPP>.appsport.com/s/index.html in your browser, enter your Jabber account (JID). The application will send you an XMPP invite (i.e. add you to their contact list). From now on you'll be able to control it via Jabber messages. You can add multiple Jabber accounts through this form. 

## Jabber message command reference
###	ping
Will respond with pong, if you've previously added your JID to the list of users.

### add HTTP_URL
Adds the given URL to the list of monitoring subjects. You will receive alerts every time the URL cannot be fetched. The actual URL that will be fetched will have a query paramerter appended to circumvent the caching mechanism of the GAE urlfetch library.

### rm HTTP_URL
Stop monitoring the URL.

### list
Lists all URLs that are currently monitored and have been added by the sender.

## Caveats/TODO
* Add monitoring tasks to a queue instead of directly fetching them in the cron callback
* Intelligent alerts, i.e. if a problem persists, reduce the alerting frequency.
* Instead of appending the current time as a query parameter, evaluate using a Cache-Control header to circumvent the urlfetch cache.
